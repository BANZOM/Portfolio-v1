# Create Your First Kubernetes Cluster Locally

You may have heard of Kubernetes and its capabilities in managing containerized applications. But have you ever considered setting up your Kubernetes cluster locally?

You might wonder why we don‚Äôt use a cloud provider like GKE, AKS, or EKS. Using a cloud service would mean that the cloud provider is in charge of the control plane, which limits learning. If we want to learn Kubernetes from scratch, we have to configure everything ourselves. Once we have done enough manual troubleshooting, we can move on to a managed Kubernetes deployment later.

## Pre-requisites

Before you begin, make sure you have a basic understanding of Kubernetes and Docker. I highly recommend catching my previous blog on [Kubernetes Architecture](/blogs/kubernetes-architecture-best-explanation) and [Docker for Beginners](/blogs/docker-tutorial-for-beginners) to understand how Kubernetes and Docker works under the hood.

## Options for Hosting a Kubernetes Cluster Locally

There are several ways to set up a Kubernetes cluster locally. Some popular options are:

1. **Minikube**: Minikube enables you to have a single node, which implements Kubernetes clusters that can run in a virtual machine on your laptop for development, experimentation, or testing purposes.

_Limitations_: Since it only supports a single node group, it lacks scalability and fault tolerance compared to a multi-node group. In addition, it may not be suitable for low-end devices.

2. **MicroK8s**: MicroK8s is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution, certified for edge, IoT, CI/CD deployments. Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu, handles development and maintenance.

_Limitations_: Not as popular as some other offerings, so community support and resources may be limited.

3. **Kind (Kubernetes in Docker)**: Kind is a tool for creating local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container ‚Äúnodes‚Äù. It is primarily designed to test Kubernetes itself, but can be used for local development or CI.

_Limitations_: It is not designed for production use, and is not recommended for use as a replacement for full Kubernetes clusters.

In this blog, we will focus on setting up a Kubernetes cluster using Kind. Since Kind is purely Docker-based and easy to set up, it is a great choice for learning Kubernetes from scratch.

## Installation and Setup

### Step 1: Initial Setup

Assuming you have Docker installed on your machine, if not, you can download it from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

### Step 2: Install Kind

You can install Kind using the following command:

On Linux:

```bash
# For AMD64 / x86_64
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.23.0/kind-linux-amd64
# For ARM64
[ $(uname -m) = aarch64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.23.0/kind-linux-arm64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind

kind version # Verify the installation
```

<br>
On macOS:

```bash
# For Intel Macs
[ $(uname -m) = x86_64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.23.0/kind-darwin-amd64
# For M1 / ARM Macs
[ $(uname -m) = arm64 ] && curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.23.0/kind-darwin-arm64
chmod +x ./kind
mv ./kind /some-dir-in-your-PATH/kind
```

<br>
On Windows (PowerShell):

```bash
curl.exe -Lo kind-windows-amd64.exe https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.23.0/kind-windows-amd64
Move-Item .\kind-windows-amd64.exe c:\some-dir-in-your-PATH\kind.exe
```

<br>

It is recommended to use the latest version of Kind. You can check the latest version on the [Kind releases page](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)

### Step 3: Install kubectl

`kind` does not include `kubectl`, so you will need to install it separately. Since you will not be able to perform some operations without `kubectl`.

For Linux: Check the Installation guide for Linux [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/)

For macOS: Check the Installation guide for macOS [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/)

For Windows: Check the Installation guide for Windows [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/)

## Setting Up a Single Node Kubernetes Cluster with Kind

Now that you have Kind and kubectl installed, let's create a single-node Kubernetes cluster using Kind.

### Step 1: Create a Cluster

To create a single-node cluster, run the following command:

```bash
kind create cluster --name single-node-cluster 
```

This command will create a single-node Kubernetes cluster named `single-node-cluster`, You can choose any name you like for your cluster.

If you want to use any specific version of Kubernetes, you can specify it using the `--image` flag. For example, to create a cluster with Kubernetes version v1.29.4, you can run

```bash
kind create cluster --name single-node-cluster --image kindest/node:v1.29.4@sha256:3abb816a5b1061fb15c6e9e60856ec40d56b7b52bcea5f5f1350bc6e2320b6f8
```
<br>

Find the available versions on the [Kind releases page](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases)

### Step 2: Verify the Cluster

To verify that the cluster has been created successfully, run:

```bash
kind get clusters
```

You should see the name of the cluster you just created in the output.

Other Ways to Verify:

- Using `kubectl`:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info --context kind-single-node-cluster
```

- Using `docker`:

```bash
docker ps
```

You should see the Kubernetes containers running.

### Step 3: Interact with the Cluster

You can interact with the cluster using `kubectl`. For example, to get the nodes in the cluster, you can run:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see the single node in the output.

### Step 4: Delete the Cluster

To delete the cluster, run:

```bash
kind delete cluster --name single-node-cluster
```

This will delete the single-node cluster you created.

## Setting Up a Multi-Node Kubernetes Cluster with Kind

Creating a multi-node cluster with Kind is similar to creating a single-node cluster. You only need to specify the number of control-plane and worker nodes.

### Step 1: Create a Multi-Node Cluster

To create a multi-node cluster with one control-plane node and two worker nodes, run:

```bash
kind create cluster --name multi-node-cluster --config multi-node-cluster.yaml
```

You need to create a configuration file `multi-node-cluster.yaml` with the following content:

```yaml
kind : Cluster
apiVersion: kind.x-k8s.io/v1alpha4
nodes:
- role: control-plane
  image: kindest/node:v1.29.4@sha256:3abb816a5b1061fb15c6e9e60856ec40d56b7b52bcea5f5f1350bc6e2320b6f8
- role: worker
  image: kindest/node:v1.29.4@sha256:3abb816a5b1061fb15c6e9e60856ec40d56b7b52bcea5f5f1350bc6e2320b6f8
- role: worker
  image: kindest/node:v1.29.4@sha256:3abb816a5b1061fb15c6e9e60856ec40d56b7b52bcea5f5f1350bc6e2320b6f8
```

This configuration file specifies one control-plane node and two worker nodes, all running Kubernetes version v1.29.4.

### Step 2: Verify the Cluster

To verify that the cluster has been created successfully, run:

```bash
kind get clusters
```

You should see the name of the multi-node cluster you just created in the output.

### Step 3: Interact with the Cluster

You can interact with the multi-node cluster using `kubectl`. For example, to get the nodes in the cluster, you can run:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You should see the control-plane node and two worker nodes in the output.

### Step 4: Delete the Cluster

To delete the cluster, run:

```bash
kind delete cluster --name multi-node-cluster
```

This will delete the multi-node cluster you created.

## Working with Multiple Clusters

You can create and manage multiple clusters using Kind. This is useful for testing applications in different environments or configurations.

To switch between clusters, you can use the `kubectl` context:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

This will show you the available contexts. The Active context is marked with a Asterisk (*).

You can switch to a different context using:

```bash
kubectl config use-context <context-name>
```

After switching the context, you can interact with the cluster using `kubectl`.

Like shown in the image below:

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Using Kind, one can easily create a Kubernetes cluster from scratch for studying purposes. It is a lightweight and easy tool, providing the functionality to create and manage Kubernetes clusters on your local machine.

In the blog above, we discussed setting up single-node and multi-node Kubernetes clusters using Kind. We also learned how to communicate with clusters by running some Kubectl commands and switching between clusters. 

We'll look at more technical details on Kubernetes in the upcoming blogs, from manifesting understanding to deploying applications and working on objects within a Kubernetes cluster.
