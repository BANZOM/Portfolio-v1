# Introduction to RAG
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cutting-edge AI technique that improves generative AI models by combining real-time external data retrieval, which adds timeliness, context, accuracy, and accountability to the generation process. RAG blends the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with external data sources, creating more coherent and intelligent solutions to user inquiries.

## Key Components and Functionalities
### 1. Retrieval Phase:
During this stage, algorithms look for and retrieve relevant information from external sources based on the user's query. These details are then added to the user prompt.
### 2. Generative Phase:
The LLM generates an answer based on the enhanced prompt and internal training data, resulting in a more engaging and contextually rich response.
### 3. Integration with LLMs:
RAG enables LLMs to deliver personalised responses without relying on manual scripting, allowing chatbots to respond to user queries more dynamically and precisely.
### 4. Continuous Learning:
RAG promotes continuous learning by allowing the model to be incrementally updated with new data, resulting in improved performance over time.

## Practical Applications
### 1. Text Summarization
RAG can provide accurate summaries by using external content, saving time on tasks such as report analysis.
### 2. Personalized Recommendations
RAG systems can create individualised product recommendations based on client data, improving the user experience and increasing revenue.
### 3. Business Intelligence
RAG helps organisations make better decisions by analysing market trends and competitor behaviour and offering context-aware responses to user queries.

## Challenges while implementing RAG
- Integration Complexity
- Scalability
- Data Quality
