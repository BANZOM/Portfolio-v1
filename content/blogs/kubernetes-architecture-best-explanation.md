# Introduction to Kubernetes 

**Kubernetes** is an open-source platform developed for the automation of deploying, scaling, and operating application containers. It groups the containers that make up an application into logical units for management and discovery.

Kubernetes is a critical deployment of modern software, as it allows for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices. This makes it possible to deploy an application in a scalable and predictable manner, avoiding human errors while allowing the speed-up of deployment. Kubernetes further results in a consistent development, test and production environment. 

Organizations can deliver top-quality software in a much quicker and more efficient manner. Higher availability with minimum resource wastage is guaranteed with self-healing and auto-scaling characteristics, making it invaluable for modern DevOps practices.

## Why Kubernetes?

Despite other container orchestration tools, such as Docker Swarm, Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration thanks to its active community, industry-wide adoption, and advanced feature set. Some of the reasons why Kubernetes is preferred are:

- **Scalability**: Kubernetes can scale out and scale up to meet your application demand.

- **Self-Healing**: It can restart containers that fail, replace and reschedule containers when nodes die, and kill containers that do not respond to your user-defined health check, all without advertising them to clients until it is ready to serve.

- **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**: It can expose a container using the DNS name or using their IP address. In that case, it will load balance and distribute network traffic when it becomes too high, ensuring the deployment stays stable.

- **Automated Rollouts and Rollbacks**: It can automatically roll out changes to your application or its configuration and roll back to the previous configurations if necessary.

So, let's dive deep into the architecture of Kubernetes and understand how it works under the hood.

## Kubernetes Architecture

![Kubernetes Architecture](/blogs/kubernetes/kubernetes_architecture.png)

Kubernetes follows a client-server architecture model. The Control Plane is the central managing unit for workloads in the cluster. It controls and maintains communication flow throughout the whole system.

It is responsible for making decisions about the cluster, such as scheduling, scaling, and updating applications.

### Components of Kubernetes Architecture

User will interact with the Kubernetes through `kubectl`, which is a command-line tool that communicates with the Kubernetes API server. 

1. **Control Plane**: The control plane or master node is the main controlling unit of the cluster, responsible for managing its workload and directing communication across the system. It consists of the following components:

    - **API Server**: The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. It is the front-end for the Kubernetes control plane and is designed to scale horizontally.

    - **Scheduler**: This component distributes the work or containers across the various nodes. It is responsible for tracking resource utilization on each node and making decisions about where to place containers based on their resource requirements.

    - **Controller Manager**: The controller manager deals with different kinds of controllers operating in the cluster. It runs controller loops that regulate the state of the cluster, such as the replication controller, endpoints controller, and service accounts controller.

    - **etcd**: It is a distributed key-value store used to hold all the cluster's configuration data, state, and metadata. It is a consistent and highly-available key-value store that Kubernetes uses to store all of its data.

2. **Nodes**: Nodes are the worker machines in Kubernetes that run applications and other workloads. They are responsible for running containers, monitoring their health, and communicating with the control plane. Nodes consist of the following components:
    
    - **Kubelet**: The kubelet is an agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It is responsible for ensuring that containers are running in a pod.

    - **Kube-proxy**: The kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in the cluster. It maintains network rules on nodes and performs connection forwarding.

    - **Pods**: Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes. They are a group of one or more containers that share storage, network, and other resources.
    
    - **Container Runtime**: The container runtime is responsible for running containers on the node. Kubernetes supports several container runtimes, including Docker, containerd, and CRI-O.

## How Kubernetes Works

Kubernetes works by managing a cluster of nodes that run containerized applications. It schedules containers to run on nodes based on their resource requirements and constraints.

## Wrapping Up

We have taken a look at the Kubernetes architecture, its components, and how these various parts work in concert with each other to facilitate the orchestration of distributed containerized applications. Kubernetes significantly simplifies the processes of deploying, scaling, and operating applications within an organization.
