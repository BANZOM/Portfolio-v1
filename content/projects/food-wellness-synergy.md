# Food & Wellness Synergy: Personalized Recipe System

In March 2024, I led the development of Food & Wellness Synergy, a personalized recipe suggestion system that harnesses the power of Advanced Gemini LLMs and Flask. This system allows users to receive customized recipe recommendations based on food products they provide, enabling them to explore a wide range of culinary options tailored to their preferences.

## Key Technologies and Features

- **HTML, CSS**: Utilized for front-end development, providing a visually appealing and intuitive user interface.
- **Python**: The primary language for back-end logic and integration with Advanced Gemini LLMs.
- **Multi-Model LLM**: Leveraged for advanced natural language processing, enhancing recipe recommendation accuracy.
- **Flask**: Used for web application development and handling user requests.
  
## User Input Flexibility

Food & Wellness Synergy offers users multiple ways to specify food products for recipe recommendations:

1. **Manual Input**: Users can type in food products manually.
2. **QR Code-Style**: Utilizing a QR code-like mechanism for quick and easy input.
3. **Image Upload**: Users can upload photos of food products for automatic recognition and recommendation.

## Customized Recipe Recommendations

The system's standout feature is its ability to provide customized recipe recommendations based on user-provided food products. By leveraging Advanced Gemini LLMs and personalized algorithms, Food & Wellness Synergy ensures that users receive tailored culinary suggestions that match their preferences.

## Impact and Future Directions

Food & Wellness Synergy represents a significant advancement in personalized recipe systems, offering users a unique and tailored culinary experience. Moving forward, I am committed to enhancing the system's capabilities, integrating more advanced AI models, and exploring new technologies to further enrich the user's culinary journey.
